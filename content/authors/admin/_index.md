I am a Moore-Sloan Faculty Fellow in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at New York University.

My research examines inequalities in public health and criminal justice. As part of this work, I evaluate the effects of social programs and interventions that aim to reduce gunshot victimization, police misconduct, and police use of force. I also develop tools to enhance transparency and accountability in policing.

Before joining NYU, I was a postdoctoral associate at Northwestern University and Yale University. I receiving my PhD from [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/) in 2017.
